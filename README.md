# GPGPU AI Task Simulator 🧠⚡

> _"Can machines think?" — Alan Turing, 1950._
>
> **This project says: Yes. Even on a 4GB Intel Core i3.**

## 🕵️‍♂️ Executive Summary

**GPGPU AI Task Simulator** is not just a simulator. It is a proof-of-concept, a whisper to the Turing Association and AI research community that _intelligence can emerge even on minimal systems_ using open technologies and smart computation.

Crafted entirely in **Python**, powered by **OpenCL**, this tool simulates AI matrix workloads such as **Matrix Multiplication**, **ReLU**, **Sigmoid**, **Softmax**, and **Tanh** with GPU acceleration—no NVIDIA required.

This is AI for **the edge**, **the curious**, and **the conscious engineer**.

---

## 🎓 Philosophy

In the spirit of **Alan Turing**, who explored the very _possibility_ of machine intelligence, this project explores its **accessibility**.

> Why should AI require datacenters?
> Why can’t it run on what you already have?

This simulator is:
- A tribute to **computational minimalism**
- A sandbox for **educational exploration**
- A technical showcase for **GPGPU parallelism in AI**
